## IMPORTANT NOTE: These are the default values for setting an acceptable
## amount of unavailable pods before a service becomes unavailable. However
## these values are immutable after first install so please take into
## consideration when selecting the appropriate numbers for your cluster
## size and preferences. While all the options listed are default values,
## this file can be changed and applied at chart installation time by
## specifying `-f pod-disruption-budgets.yaml`.
